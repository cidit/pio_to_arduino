# pio_to_arduino

This project serves as a quick and dirty tool to turn a project made using PlatformIO into a folder structure that the arduino IDE will accept to run and compile. This was necessary for me because my teacher grades the solutions in the IDE itself, and if he cant even open my project, well, that's a problem.
